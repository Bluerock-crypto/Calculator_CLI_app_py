This is a **proper README** with all the details included — features, how to run, tech stack, learning outcomes, structure, improvements, and acknowledgements.  

Would you like me to also suggest a **short GitHub repo description and tags** (like `python`, `cli`, `calculator`, `internship`) so your project looks polished and discoverable?
